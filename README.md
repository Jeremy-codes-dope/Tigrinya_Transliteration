# Tigrinya_Transliteration

This is a simple but power ful project that changes amharic scripts in to englisch letters just in a second. it uses a list of scripts in excel and delivers the english transliteration in the same format.

The intention was to automate the tiresome work my mother had to do and save her all the energy and time. My mother used to work as a secretary in a local firm and one day this chunck of name came to her work desk to be transliterated and typed in to English. I guess she had  belief on me and come on to me to do some to save her from the un necessary effort in this automation world. then I came up with a python code that reads the scripts and transliterate them in to english alphabets.
